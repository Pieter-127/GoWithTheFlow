# GoWithTheFlow

Playground for learning [some basics with Flows](https://github.com/Pieter-127/GoWithTheFlow/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/pieter/gowiththeflow/MainActivity.kt)
with some very very basic [tests](https://github.com/Pieter-127/GoWithTheFlow/blob/main/app/src/test/java/com/pieter/gowiththeflow/FlowTesting.kt). Not necessarily practical examples, mostly just to try stuff out
